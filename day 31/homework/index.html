        <p style="font-size: 100px; color:red ;">In physics, sound is a vibration<br>
             that propagates as an acoustic wave through a <br>
              transmission medium such as a gas,<br>
               liquid or solid. In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception<br>
                by the brain.[1] Only acoustic waves that have frequencies <br>
                lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, elicit an auditory <br>
                percept in humans. In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with <br>
                wavelengths of 17 meters (56 ft) to 1.7 centimeters (0.67 in). Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and<br>
                 are not audible to humans. Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound. Different animal species have varying <br>
                 hearing ranges, allowing some to even hear ultrasounds.</p>
