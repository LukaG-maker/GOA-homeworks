        <h1 style="color:aqua; background-color: aliceblue;text-align: center;">what is an atom?</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(52, 186, 52) ;font: size 100px;text-align: center;">Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements. An atom consists of<br>
             a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons. <br>
             The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For <br>
             example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons<br>
             is copper. Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons <br>
             are called isotopes of the same element.</p>
