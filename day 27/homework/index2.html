    <p>Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the American technology conglomerate Meta. 
        Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. 
        Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. 
        Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years.
         As of December 2023, Facebook claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide.
          As of November 2024, Facebook ranked as the third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States.
          It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site to a global social networking service.
        While attending Phillips Exeter in the early 2000's, Zuckerberg met Kris Tillery. 
        Tillery, a one-time project collaborator with Zuckerberg, would create a school-based social networking project called Photo Address Book. 
        Photo Address Book was a digital face book, created through a linked database composed of student information derived from the official records of the Exeter student council. 
        The database contained linkages such as name, dorm-specific landline numbers, and student headshots.
